Following the exploration of a tutorial on FreePIE, I saw that it is using python.

And apparently there is py feeder:  
`pip install pyvjoy`

pyautogui

``` py
import time
from pyvjoy import VJoyDevice

# Define the vJoy device
vjoy_device = VJoyDevice(1)  # You can specify the vJoy device ID here (usually 1)

try:
    while True:
        # Read the state of button 0
        button_state = vjoy_device.get_button(0)

        # Check if button 0 is pressed (1) or not (0)
        if button_state == 1:
            print("Button 0 is pressed")
        else:
            print("Button 0 is not pressed")

        time.sleep(0.1)  # Add a small delay to avoid continuous polling

except KeyboardInterrupt:
    pass  # Exit the loop when the user presses Ctrl+C

finally:
    # Close the vJoy device
    vjoy_device.close()

```
