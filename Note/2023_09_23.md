# vJoy 

- https://github.com/shauleiz/vJoy
  - https://sourceforge.net/projects/vjoystick/
  - https://sourceforge.net/projects/vjoywrapper/v

- https://sourceforge.net/projects/vjoystick/files/Beta%202.x/SDK/
 
Wrapper: 
- https://github.com/bobhelander/vJoy.Wrapper/tree/master

- "If your feeder is designed to feed only vJoy devices, you should not use this API. Use vJoyInterface.dll instead."

# HIDSharp

  - This tool is perfect... But I don't have time and it is a lot's of code to just simulate a vJoy tool. Perfect for future use.
